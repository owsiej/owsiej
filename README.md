<h1 align="left">Hey 👋 What's up?</h1>

I'm a Michał from Poland. I am qualified construction manager😆. Now you may think what am I doing here?😕 So after 5 years of hard work on construction site I've decided to change my carrier path by 180 degrees↩️ . I always used to get along with computers😜 and if not my highschool teacher maybe I could have gone straight into IT. But who wants to have his life so simple? Lets make it spicy a bit😈.

## Current carrier path 📔

- 🐵 **First steps**: As a self-taught programmer I have started from Python. The idea behind this language was mainly simple syntax(yes, yes tabs are way more clearer for newbie then {} 😍). I finished many courses, mostly on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). All this resulted into few projects which you can find in my repos, for example:
  - [Django Scrape App](https://github.com/owsiej/DeveloperScrapeDjango) - scraping app which gather data about investments/flats from websites of all biggest developers in my home city, Białystok, and sets it in simple html page. Project used to be hosted on Azure Cloud but because of 💰 I had to get it off from there.
  - [Flask Scrape App](https://github.com/owsiej/Developer-Scrape) - same concept as higher but this time everything was put in REST API, a bit outdated for today
  - [Mortgage register scrapper](https://github.com/owsiej/ksiegiScrape) - another scrapper😜, but this one uses very popular library called `scrapy-splash`
- 🐎 **Then...**: During an economic downturn💩, particularly within the IT sector, I pursued professional development by enrolling in a postgraduate JavaScript Developer program at my local university of technology, which I am about to finish with highest possible degree🎓. Those studies equipped me with the skills to work effectively with technologies like **React, Angular, Node** and motivated me to expand my knowledge even more, for example with **NestJs**. Here are some of my projects:
  - [Snake Game App](https://github.com/owsiej/snake-game-angular) - popular snake game coded in **Angular** as part of my postgraduate studies final paper
  - [Score API](https://github.com/owsiej/scores-api) - my personal project to work as backend for snake game
  - [Simple shop template](https://github.com/owsiej/shop-react) - coded in **React**, also final paper from postgraduate studies
  - [Advert CRUD API](https://github.com/owsiej/advert-api) - another final paper from postgraduate studies, complete CRUD API in **Node**, `Express`
- 🔭 **I'm currently working on** adjusting [Snake Game App](https://github.com/owsiej/snake-game-angular) to new [backend](https://github.com/owsiej/scores-api) and frontend for [Advert CRUD API](https://github.com/owsiej/advert-api).
- 🙏 **I'm looking for** job or intern as Fullstack/Frontend/Backend Developer in my preferred techs. As construction manager and captain of football team I have got very good interpersonal skills, know what teamwork means and how to manage projects.
- 👉 **Fun fact:** I love playing football and I am captain of local amateur football team.
